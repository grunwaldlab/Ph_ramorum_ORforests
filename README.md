R code to reproduce the figures is in `pub_figures.Rmd`.

Be sure to load the R data file into your R environment, which contains the necessary metadata and SSR data (in genind/genclone format) in the `genclones_from_SSRs.Rd` file. 

Metadata and other important data structures for figures can be loaded from `sample_info_all.Rd`.
